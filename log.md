# Game 2 dev log
Here be my thoughts and feelings and vibes while developing this game.

Alrighty, getting the main menu controller-usable. For this I want... a Controller global that keeps track of whether the last input was the keyboard/mouse or a gamepad. The output from this can be used to display the right kind of icons.

update: Menu gamepad control is now mostly working thanks to [a tut from Nathan Hoad](https://youtu.be/p_m3xgWAFo0)!! Still need to get mouse and the pointer image position working nicely.

update: 2D Sidescroller Player is now using state charts, whoo. What a fun tool!

Platformer movement is feeling nice, and I've got the palette stuff working. First off let's make the main menu controller-usable, then I want to explore the intro VN-like sequence.

What do I want from 'Game 2'? I'd say an expression. I've made a set of games but always feel like I never really have anything to say... or maybe that's just not exploring myself that deeply when it comes to these projects. This is the first project after high school where I'm gonna be diving into using assets made by others. I want to actually finish this project, so yeah. The thing that matters here are the vibes, not that every single pixel is drawn by me, so yeah. We'll see how it goes.

It's important that the identity of this game is a bit fluid. That's why I have so many title cards, and I'm planning to add more. When I was at Squiggly River the other week I sketched up a game based on the word 'capstone' - I like that, will incorporate that somehow.

Given the 3-5 minute runtime requirement, and that games _should_ be able to be picked up, played for a bit, and then moved on from, I'll avoid having a specific screen at the start where people can set specifics. Instead, the triggers will let people switch 'vibes'. Vibes are like: Curly, Red, Water, Splotchy, Pink, etc.
